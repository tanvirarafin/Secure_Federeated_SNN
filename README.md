# FL-SNN
Code for Federated Neuromorphic Learning of Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Edge Intelligence (arXiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09594)

## Files
The SNN.py file implements the SNN class \
Training an SNN to discriminate between two digits on the MNIST-DVS dataset can be done by running mnist_test.py \
Distributed experiments as described in the paper are implemented in the mnist_online_distributed.py and mnist_online_distributed_fixed_rate.py files
